**Semi-Supervised Learning**

- uses a small portion of labeled data and lots of unlabeled data to train a predictive model
- iteratively generate pseudo-labels for a new dataset

**Reinforcement Learning**

- Markov Decision Process
- Q learning
- Value-based           V(s)

  - the agent is expecting a long-term return of the current states under policy π
- Policy-based

  - the action performed in every state helps you to gain maximum reward in the future
  - Deterministic: For any state, the same action is produced by the policy π
  - Stochastic: Every action has a certain probability
- Model-based

  - create a virtual model for each environment
  - the agent learns to perform in that specific environment

### Feature Engineering

- Feature Selection
  - After fitting, plot Residuals vs any Predictor Variable
  - Linearly-dependent feature vectors
- Imputation
- Handling Outliers
  - Removal, Replacing values, Capping, Discretization
- Encoding
  - Integer Encoding
  - One-Hot Encoding (enum -> binary)
- Scaling
  - Normalization, min-max/ 0-1
  - Standardization
